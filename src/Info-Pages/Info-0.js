          The purpose of this study is to investigate user experience and trust
          in an online voting system intended for general elections.
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Description of research</h3>
        <Text>
          Before entering the voting system, you will be asked to download an
          instruction paper for the voting system. After entering the system,
          you are asked to test the voting system by following the instruction
          paper. This will be followed by a questionnaire, which you will get
          redirected to from the last page of the voting system. Once you have
          completed the questionnaire, you will be redirected to Prolific. The
          total duration of the study is approximately 30 minutes. We highly
          recommend using a desktop device for the study.
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Withdrawal</h3>
        <Text>
          You can withdraw your consent about being part of the study at any
          time before the completion of the study, meaning before you submit the
          survey. In this case your collected data will be deleted by the
          researchers. For more information on how to withdraw from a study
          before completion in Prolific, see this link:{" "}
          <Link

          </Link>
          . Please note that we cannot delete your data after you have completed
          the study, since the data we collect is anonymised and we therefore
          have no chance to identify you (unless you choose to disclose
          identifying information about yourself when using the voting system or
          answering the questionnaire, in which case your data will be
          anonymised as described below).
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Compensation</h3>
        <Text>
          Each participant will receive 4.50 £ at the conclusion of the study
          through Prolific.
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">How we handle and delete the data</h3>
        <Text>
          If a participant discloses any personal information about themselves
          or other people in the voting system or when answering the
          questionnaire, the researchers will remove this from the dataset and
          replace it with a placeholder.{" "}
          {/* The non-anonymised data set will be
          deleted after the study has been completed (latest 31st of December
          2023). */}
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">What data we collect</h3>
        <Text>
          The participants will be asked to share the following personal data:
        </Text>

        <UnorderedList className="text-margin-top">
          <ListItem>Gender</ListItem>
          <ListItem>Age</ListItem>
          <ListItem>Nationality</ListItem>
          <ListItem>Level of education</ListItem>
        </UnorderedList>
        <Text className="text-margin-top">
          We further collect the answers that the participants give to the
          questions in the questionnaire, as well as data related to voting and
          vote verification that the participants are asked to provide within
          the voting system. Please note that all candidates on the digital
          voting paper are fictional and the participants are asked to vote for
          a specific candidate before they enter the voting system. Therefore,
          we do not collect any sensitive personal data on political interests.
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">How we use the data</h3>
        <Text>
          The data will be used to derive statistical measures of user
          experience and trust in the presented e-voting system. The data might
          be referenced, but not printed in full, in the research report which
          will be published internally at ITU as a Master Thesis Report (meaning
          that researchers and future students at ITU might have access to the
          report). They might also be used in aggregated form in academic
          publishing, meaning that no individual answers will be mentioned, but
          only overall results will appear.
        </Text>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Who has access to the data?</h3>
        <Text>
          The researchers have access to the original data until it has been
          edited to replace given personal information with placeholders to
          anonymise it. The anonymised data will be made available to the
          supervising researchers and the external censor assessing the project.
